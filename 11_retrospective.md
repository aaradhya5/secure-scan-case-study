## Retrospective
- The SecureScan case study aimed to address a clear gap in the SMB market: simple, affordable vulnerability scanning and system health monitoring. Throughout the process, a few key insights and trade-offs emerged:

**What Went Well:**
- Clear Problem-Solution Fit: The need for lightweight security tools in SMBs was well validated through user personas and feature prioritization.
- Focused MVP Scope: Limiting the initial build to core features (scan, report, alert) helped maintain clarity and avoid scope creep.
- Strong Differentiation: Positioning around simplicity, low setup time, and no technical expertise resonated well with non-technical users.
**Trade-offs Made:**
- Dashboard De-prioritized: While a central dashboard was desirable, it was pushed to Phase 3 to keep the MVP lean.
- Cloud & Mobile Support Excluded: To maintain focus, cloud syncing and mobile apps were excluded from early development, despite long-term value.
**Key Learnings:**
- SMB users value clear, actionable output over detailed technical reports.
- A CLI-first approach works for technical users but needs onboarding support for others.
- Early feedback loops (e.g. via beta testers) are critical for refining core features.
**Next Steps:**
- Add basic onboarding flows and interactive setup guidance.
- Begin early dashboard prototyping for multi-device use cases.
- Explore integrations (e.g., Slack, email, MSP tools) in the next iteration.
