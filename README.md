#   Lightweight Vulnerability Scanner for SMBs

##  Description

    SecureScan is a lightweight, conceptual cybersecurity product tailored for small-to-medium businesses (SMBs), enabling them to detect system vulnerabilities and monitor health — without relying on complex tools or dedicated security teams.


##  Problem Statement

    Small-to-medium businesses often lack the budget or expertise for enterprise-grade security solutions, leaving them vulnerable to cyberattacks, data breaches, and compliance issues. Existing solutions may be too complex to manage or too expensive to implement, creating a significant security gap.

##  User Personas

    * **IT Manager:** Needs automated vulnerability scanning and reporting to minimize manual effort and ensure continuous monitoring.
    * **Non-technical Founder:** Requires a clear, high-level overview of system security and health, with actionable alerts that do not demand technical expertise.
    * **System Administrator:** Prefers a fast, efficient command-line interface tool for quick security checks and system diagnostics, with the ability to integrate into existing scripting.

##  Solution Vision

    SecureScan provides SMBs with a lightweight scanner that delivers essential security and system health insights. Key features include vulnerability detection, system health checks (CPU, memory, disk), real-time alerts, and easy setup, enabling proactive threat management, improved system stability, and reduced risk of security incidents.

##  Product Strategy

    The product strategy targets SMBs needing simple, affordable security solutions. Differentiation is achieved through low overhead, fast deployment, and clear, actionable outputs.

##  Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope

    The MVP scope includes:

    * Command-line interface-based scanner
    * System health monitoring (CPU, memory, disk)
    * Scheduled scans
    * Alerts via email and Slack

    "Lightweight" refers to minimal resource usage and a small installation size.

    Cloud or dashboard features are excluded from the MVP.

##  User Stories

    * As an IT Manager, I want to schedule automatic scans so that I can continuously monitor systems for vulnerabilities without manual intervention.
    * As a Non-technical Founder, I want to receive alerts for critical vulnerabilities so that I can take immediate action to protect my business.
    * As a System Administrator, I want to view quick summaries of system health from the command-line interface so that I can quickly diagnose potential issues.

##  Success Metrics

    Success will be measured by:

    * **Setup:** 90% of users completing the initial setup in under 10 minutes.
    * **Detection Accuracy:** Achieving a vulnerability detection accuracy rate of 95% or higher, measured against a known vulnerability database.
    * **Adoption:** Acquiring 500 or more active users within the first 6 months of launch.
    * **User Satisfaction:** Achieving an average user satisfaction rating of 4.5 or higher (out of 5) based on user surveys collected 3 months post-launch.

##  Wireframes

    Wireframes include:

    
##  Go-To-Market Plan

    The go-to-market plan involves:

    * Beta testing with 10 SMBs (recruited from online SMB communities and cybersecurity forums)
    * Product Hunt launch
    * Blog outreach and partnerships (targeting small business blogs and cybersecurity news sites)
    * A free tier and a paid plan for advanced features

##  Retrospective

    Key retrospective points:

    * Clear value for SMBs
    * Recommendation: Simplify the initial configuration process by reducing the number of required command-line arguments.
